# Getting Started

## Installation for developers

To create a development environment you need **node.js** and **npm**: https://nodejs.org

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/de-bkg/geo.okapi.git
cd geo.okapi

# Install npm packages
# It creates folder node_modules with all packages listed in package.json
npm install

# compile ol
npm run compile-ol 

# build libraries
npm run build
```

To explore the examples within the directory of the same name you have to build the libraries.
